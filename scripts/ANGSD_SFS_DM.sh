#   This is the ANGSD script from RILab's BigD study,
#   modified for running on MSI by TomJKono.

#   Last Modified: 2014-06-11
#   CHANGES
#		2014-06-20
#           - New version of script for analyzing deleterious mutations data
#             at 18 loci
#		2014-06-17
#           - Changed parameters so that we could estimate the derived SFS, required
#             -doMaf 1 and -doMajorMinor 1 
#       2014-06-11
#           - Cleaned uop the script, fixed some directory names for pointing
#             to directories in our MSI shared space.

#	This is the root of our shared directory
SHARED=/home/morrellp/shared
#	And our data directory
DATA_DIR=${SHARED}/Datasets/NGS/Alignments/Deleterious_Mutations
#   The directory of our reference sequence
REF_DIR=${SHARED}/References/Reference_Sequences/Barley/Morex
#   This sequence is the pseudo-scaffolds from Martin
REF_SEQ=Morex_Reference.fasta
#   Since ANGSD's version is in the directory name, we reference them both
#   in this way
ANGSD_VERSION=0.602
ANGSD_DIR=${SHARED}/Software/angsd${ANGSD_VERSION}
#	The file that contains the paths to the BAM files we are analyzing
DM_BAM_LIST=${DATA_DIR}/DM_BAMList.list
DM_INBREEDING=${DATA_DIR}/indF_coeff.txt
#   The number of individuals in the taxon we are analyzing
#   We use an embedded command to do this
#   ( wc -l < FILE will return just the line count of FILE,
#   rather than the line count and the filename. More efficient than piping
#   to a separate 'cut' process!)
N_IND=`wc -l < ${DM_BAM_LIST}`
#   For ANGSD, the actual sample size is twice the number of individuals, since
#   each individual has two chromosomes. The individual inbreeding coefficents
#   take care of the mismatch between these two numbers
N_CHROM=`expr 2 \* ${N_IND}`

#   This first command estimates the site frequency spectrum
#   Options:
#       -bam [FILE]
#           List of bam file paths in [FILE]
#       -out [FILE]
#           Output SFS to [FILE]
#       -doSaf [1|2|3|4]
#           Model used to determine genotype likelihoods
#               1: Assume HWE
#               2: Take into account individual inbreeding coefficients.
#                  Requires the -indF argument (We will use this one)
#               3: Calculate posterior allele frequency dist. from the file
#                  generated by -doSaf 1. (Seems circular?)
#               4: Calculate posterior probabilities given genotype probs
#                  from another source. Requires -beagle.
#       -uniqueOnly [0/1]
#           0: Do not use only unique reads
#           1: Use only uniquely mapped reads (we use this one)
#       -anc [FILE] 
#           ancestral sequence (see trip.sh script for how this is generated)
#           This is a FASTA file
#       -minMapQ [INT]
#           Minimum mapping quality of reads to accept. MapQ is a Phred-scaled
#           probability of a read having an incorrect mapping position
#       -minQ [INT]
#           Minimum base quality to be used in calculations. This is the Phred
#           scaled quality score that comes with the FASTQ reads
#       -minInd [INT]
#           Important parameter; specifies how many individuals are allowed to
#           have missing data at a site. Sites above this threshhold will be
#           filtered from the analysis
#       -setMaxDepth [INT] 
#           Maximum depth to consider, good for filtering out highly repetitive
#           regions from analysis
#       -baq [0/1]
#           Use the Base Alignment Quality score feature
#           See http://samtools.sourceforge.net/mpileup.shtml and Li 2011
#           http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/8/1157.long
#           for more information. 
#               1: Use BAQ, which tries to account for false positive variation
#                  due to misalignment across indels. It assigns a Phred-scaled
#                  probability that the base is misaligned
#               0: Do not use BAQ
#       -GL [1|2|3|4]
#           Model used to calculate genotype likelihoods
#           Explained: http://popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Genotype_Likelihoods
#               1: SAMTools
#               2: GATK (We will use this one)
#               3: SOAPsnp
#               4: SYK
#       -r [RANGE]
#           Operate only on [RANGE], given in standard genomic coordinate form
#           i.e., chr:start-stop (morex_contig_1:1-100)
#       -P [INT]
#           Use [INT] threads
#       -indF
#           individiual inbreeding coefficient. for inbred lines just make a
#           files of "1" on each line for each bamfile. otherwise use ngsF
#           to estimate (see inbreeding.sh script)
#       -r [REGION] / [FILE]
#           operate over [REGION] or the regions denoted in [FILE]
#           One region per line, specified in standard genomic coordinate
#           format, chr:start-stop
#           e.g., morex_contig_1:1-100

#   We set operation-specific parameters here.
#   Hopefully these variable names make sense . . .

#   This next command estimates the SFS
#   Notes from JRI:
#       -fold option seems deprecated
#       the .saf output file is prior on SFS, probably
#       number of chromosomes is 2x number of samples
#       .em.ml output file is the final estimate of SFS
#       final SFS estimate will be ln(P) where P is the probability of the
#       values of SFS from 0 to the sample size. (will give n+1 values total)
#       for polymorphic sites, ignore the first and last numbers
#       first number is ln(proportion fixed for ancestral allele)
#       last number is ln(proportion fixed for derived allele)
