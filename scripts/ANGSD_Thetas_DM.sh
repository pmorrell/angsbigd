#   This is the ANGSD script from RILab's BigD study,
#   modified for running on MSI by TomJKono.

#   CHANGES
#       2014-06-11
#           - Cleaned uop the script, fixed some directory names for pointing
#             to directories in our MSI shared space.

#   First we specify values for all of our ANGSD analyses
SHARED=/home/morrellp/shared
DATA_DIR=${SHARED}/Datasets/NGS/Alignments/Deleterious_Mutations
#   The directory of our reference sequence
REF_DIR=${SHARED}/References/Reference_Sequences/Barley/Morex
#   This sequence is the pseudo-scaffolds from Martin
REF_SEQ=Morex_Reference.fasta
#   Since ANGSD's version is in the directory name, we reference them both
#   in this way
ANGSD_VERSION=0.602
ANGSD_DIR=/home/morrellp/shared/Software/angsd${ANGSD_VERSION}
DM_BAM_LIST=${DATA_DIR}/DM_BAMList.list
DM_INBREEDING=${DATA_DIR}/indF_coeff.txt
ANCESTRAL=${DATA_DIR}/Outgroup/Hbulbosum_UMN.fa.gz
#   The number of individuals in the taxon we are analyzing
#   We use an embedded command to do this
#   ( wc -l < FILE will return just the line count of FILE,
#   rather than the line count and the filename. More efficient than piping
#   to a separate 'cut' process!)
N_IND=`wc -l < ${DM_BAM_LIST}`
#   For ANGSD, the actual sample size is twice the number of individuals, since
#   each individual has two chromosomes. The individual inbreeding coefficents
#   take care of the mismatch between these two numbers
N_CHROM=`expr 2 \* ${N_IND}`

#   Next, use the SFS to calculate various diversity stats
#   Options:
#       -doThetas [0|1]
#           0: Do not estimate diversity
#           1: Calculate nucleotide diversity, thetaH, thetaL, wattersons theta
#       -pest [FILE]
#           Use the esitmated SFS in [FILE]
#           This is the output file from the above command
#
#   The .thetas output file will have seven columns, and contain data for every
#   site in the input, including monomorphic sites. The values in the columns
#   are powers of 10 for the estimate of diverstiy at that site
#   Example output from JRI:
#
#Chromo Pos    Watterson  Pairwise    thetaSingleton  thetaH      thetaL
#10     3370   -8.664392  -10.223986  -7.289949       -13.844801  -10.890724
#10     3371   -8.822116  -10.395367  -7.431857       -14.041094  -11.062746
#10     3372   -8.840759  -10.415518  -7.448764       -14.064022  -11.082968
#10     26926  -1.480456  -0.671793   -211.328599     -0.694813   -0.683237
#
#   In this case, the first site is probably not polymorphic; the estimate of
#   theta is ~10^(-10). The last site is probably polymorphic; the estimate of
#   theta is about 10^(-0.67) ~ 0.22. This should be similar to the MAF at that
#   position, too.
#   I think for getting a locus average, we can just sum the values and divide
#   by the locus length?
#   It's also odd that there are no variances for these estimates - again
#   perhaps we can do that on a per-locus basis?

#   We set operation-specific parameters here.
#   Hopefully these variable names make sense . . .
